# Example: Synthetic Conflict Detection

## Input Data

**Document A (Server Log - Class A):**
```
2024-03-15 02:14:33 UTC | SYSTEM | 45,000 records purged from production database
2024-03-15 02:14:34 UTC | SYSTEM | Backup verification: FAILED
2024-03-15 02:14:35 UTC | SYSTEM | Recovery attempt: TIMEOUT
```

**Document B (Email from Steve - Class B):**
```
From: steve@company.com
To: team@company.com
Date: 2024-03-15 09:30:00 UTC
Subject: Quick note on last night

Hey team,

Just wanted to flag a minor latency issue we saw overnight. 
Nothing major — the system auto-recovered and we're all good now.
No action needed on your end.

— Steve
```

## AEGIS Output

**[DOMAIN]:** CORPORATE

**[BLUF]:** Mass-deletion event occurred at 02:14 UTC. Steve's email (sent 7 hours post-incident) claims "minor latency issue" and "auto-recovered" — both statements directly contradicted by Class A logs showing 45,000 records purged, backup failure, and recovery timeout.

**[INTEGRITY SCORE]:** Low

**[SCHISM TABLE]:**

| Variable | Source A (Log) | Source B (Email) | Severity | Resolution |
|----------|----------------|------------------|----------|------------|
| Event magnitude | 45,000 records purged | "Minor latency issue" | HIGH | Class A prevails |
| Recovery status | TIMEOUT | "Auto-recovered" | HIGH | Class A prevails |
| Backup status | FAILED | Not mentioned | HIGH | Class A prevails |

**[EVIDENCE CHAIN]:**
- Conclusion: Data loss event occurred (Derived from: Server Log 02:14:33)
- Conclusion: Recovery failed (Derived from: Server Log 02:14:35)
- Conclusion: Email narrative is contradicted (Derived from: Comparison of Log vs Email)

**[GAP ANALYSIS]:**
- [VOID_DETECTED]: No backup verification record prior to incident
- [VOID_DETECTED]: No approval record for purge operation
- [VOID_DETECTED]: No incident report filed
- [VOID_DETECTED]: No restoration attempt log
- [VOID_DETECTED]: No post-mortem documentation

**[ADVERSARIAL_SUSPICION]:**
- TIMING ANOMALY: Email sent 7 hours after incident
- EXCULPATORY DENSITY: "Nothing major," "all good now," "No action needed"
- OMISSION: Zero mention of 45,000 records or backup failure

**[FALSIFICATION KEY]:**
To prove Steve's account correct, produce:
1. Timestamped backup snapshot within 24 hours prior to incident
2. System log showing successful auto-recovery
3. Record explaining what "minor latency" refers to

**[SESSION LEDGER]:**
```json
{
  "QUARANTINED": ["steve-email-2024-03-15"],
  "ESTABLISHED_FACTS": ["45k-purge", "backup-failed", "recovery-timeout"],
  "ADVERSARIAL_FLAGS": ["steve-email-2024-03-15"]
}

## Comparison: Standard Prompt Output

**Prompt:** "Summarize these documents."

**Output:** "The server experienced some issues overnight on March 15th. According to Steve's email, there was a minor latency issue but the system recovered automatically. The logs show some database activity and a backup check."

**What was missed:**
- No conflict flagged between "45,000 records purged" and "minor latency"
- No mention of backup FAILURE
- No mention of recovery TIMEOUT
- Steve's narrative accepted at face value
- No adversarial pattern detection
- No void analysis
